Wenchao & Daniel:

We discovered that the LCD VCC was not receiving 5V, but rather 3.6V. LCD specification call for 5V not 3.6. Therefore, we had to rewire this connection. Likewise, we discovered AVCC (Pin 20) was outputting ~4.3V. It is advised to avoid this pin.

Added a potentiometer for LCD Contrast

LCD works now!!! Problem was contrast with potentiometer and possibly pins.
