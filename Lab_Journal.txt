Wenchao & Daniel:

We discovered that the LCD VCC was not receiving 5V, but rather 3.6V. LCD specification call for 5V not 3.6. Therefore, we had to rewire this connection. Likewise, we discovered AVCC (Pin 20) was outputting ~4.3V. It is advised to avoid this pin. LCD still does not output characters. Further troubleshooting needed.
